Masahiro Sakurai recently gave [an interview with The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/aug/08/super-smash-bros-ultimate-masahiro-sakurai-35-years-gaming-history-nintendo) where he discussed the Super Smash Bros. series, where he shared some interesting information regarding his views on game design and sequels. It seems that despite looking the same, he&#39;s definitely changed his views on the industry since the day he left HAL Laboratory.
